This is a selective copy of the edid tool written by

  Laurent Pinchart <laurent.pinchart@ideasonboard.com>

The edid tool is originally part of a set of tools to work with 
subdevices and the original repo is:

  git://git.ideasonboard.com/xilinx/edid.git

Tool is copied to the vin-tests repo since it can't be expected to be 
found in many distributions. And it's needed to be able to program EDID 
information on subdevices pads. Once v4l-utils or other more generic 
tool gains this ability the vin-tests scripts should be updated to use 
such tool instead.
